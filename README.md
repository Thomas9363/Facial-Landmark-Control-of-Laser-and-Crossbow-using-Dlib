# Facial-Landmark-Control-of-Laser-and-Crossbow-using-Dlib
This project employs eye blinking and mouth opening using Dlib as control inputs to activate a panning servo-mounted laser beam and crossbow. The servo angle is dynamically adjusted by monitoring changes in the shape of the eyes, while the laser/ crossbow is triggered by detecting changes in the mouth.
